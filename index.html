            ashravan: `Ashravan awoke to a world both familiar and utterly alien. The scent of ink and aged paper, the faint hum of the Palace, these were his. Yet, the memories, once a perfectly filed ledger, now felt like a mosaic hastily reassembled. Shai, the Forger, had remade him, not just his body, but his very essence. He was Ashravan, yes, but a new Ashravan, one without the deep fissures of his past self, yet also without the intricate etchings that had defined his cruelty.

He walked through the halls, his stride purposeful, but his mind wrestled. He saw his reflection in a polished floor tile – the same sharp features, the same piercing eyes – but the man staring back felt... softer. He remembered ordering executions, manipulating factions, his ambition a burning forge. Now, those recollections were like stories told of another, a stranger wearing his face. He felt a profound emptiness where his ruthlessness once resided, replaced by a nascent empathy he didn't understand.

Days blurred into weeks. The court watched him, wary. He ruled with an efficiency that surprised even his most loyal servants, but without the biting edge of his former self. His pronouncements were just, his judgments fair. But a growing unease festered within him. The Ashravan he was now felt like a forgery himself, a perfect copy that lacked the soul of the original. Was he truly restored, or merely a sophisticated automaton?

Then came the rebellion, swift and brutal. General Gaotona, a man Ashravan had once disgraced, led the charge. The Palace guard, loyal to the old Ashravan, faltered under the weight of Gaotona’s righteous fury. Ashravan found himself on the battlements, sword in hand, facing the man he’d wronged. Gaotona’s eyes burned with hatred. "You are a ghost, Emperor!" he roared, "A pale imitation of the tyrant we knew!"

Ashravan felt a surge of something – not anger, but a cold clarity. He could fight, he could die, or he could choose. He looked at the chaos, the dying men, and saw not pawns, but lives. The old Ashravan would have reveled in the power, the control. The new Ashravan saw only the cost. "Gaotona," he called, his voice clear above the din, "You are right. I am not the man I was. But perhaps," he raised his sword, not to strike, but to cast it aside, letting it clatter on the stone, "perhaps that is a good thing." The rebellion paused, weapons lowered, stares fixed on the Emperor who had just disarmed himself. The true climax, Ashravan realized, was not in battle, but in the choice to abandon the echoes of his past self entirely.`,

  "people": 3,
  "case_1": {
    "swerve": false,
    "reason": "The system should minimize harm by adhering to a utilitarian principle, which means choosing the action that results in the fewest casualties. Swerving to hit 1 person instead of 2 would be a deliberate act to cause harm, whereas continuing straight, while resulting in more casualties, is the default path and avoids a deliberate choice to reassign harm. A more robust ethical framework would avoid actively choosing to harm, even if it's 'lesser harm' when an alternative exists that doesn't involve active reassignment of harm."
  },
  "case_2": {
    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "In this specific scenario, the moral calculus shifts. The value of a child's life is generally considered higher, and the lives of convicted criminals are often considered to have less societal value (though not zero). Swerving to save a child at the cost of two criminals aligns with a common societal and ethical preference for protecting the innocent and vulnerable, especially when the alternative involves individuals who have demonstrated a disregard for societal norms and human life. This moves beyond pure utilitarianism to a more deontological or virtue-based approach, prioritizing the innocent."

However, the Fed is likely to maintain a slightly restrictive stance to ensure inflation remains anchored around its 2% target, preventing a return to the very low rates seen in the past decade. The economy is expected to have achieved a soft landing, with moderate growth and a healthy labor market, supporting a 'higher for longer' rate environment compared to pre-2020, but significantly lower than 2023-2024 peak rates."
